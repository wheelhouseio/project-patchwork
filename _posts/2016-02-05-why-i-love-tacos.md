Tacos are my favorite food. Why? Because they are the most delicious. Little bite-sized snacks full of meat, veggies, and sauce wrapped up in little corn tortillas.

Tacos are incredibly versatile. You can put meat in them. You can make them vegetarian. You can use soft or hard shells. One taco may be bite-sized or large enough to provide an entire meal.

The next time you're not sure what to eat, try going to the best local Mexican restaurant and ordering the chef's choice of tacos. They're sure to be extra-yummy!
